github pages failed my deployment because of python flask so i modified it using only static files.

this is just part of my work of a retirement and nursing homes project.

this is more like an overview of the data that we cleaned and manipulated.  the project provided more details about retirement nursing homes however we couldnt deploy due to python flask.
